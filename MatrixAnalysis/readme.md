## E5600 - Linear System Theory

### Project on Davis-Wielandt Shells

#### Key Tasks: 

(a) Understand the concept of DW shells in the linear algebra literature. Prove that the DW shell
of n × n matrix is convex with n ≥ 3.

(b) Study
C.K. Li, Y.-T. Poon, and N.-S. Sze, “Eigenvalues of the sum of matrices from unitary
similarity orbit”, SIAM Journal on Matrix Analysis and Applications, vol. 30, pp.
560-581, 2008.

(c) Prove the main result of Theorem 2.1 in the above paper using your own language. Try to go further
in this line.
